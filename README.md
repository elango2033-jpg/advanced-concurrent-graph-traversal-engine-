# advanced-concurrent-graph-traversal-engine-
This project requires the implementation of a high-performance, thread-safe graph traversal algorithm, specifically focusing on either Dijkstra's shortest path or the A search algorithm. The implementation must leverage modern concurrency primitives , to parallelize the exploration of nodes, particularly when managing the priority queue .
